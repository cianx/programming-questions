# STRINGS

## REORDER
* Reverse words in a string
	(words are separated by one or more spaces).
	Now do it in-place.
	By far the most popular string question!
* Reverse a string
** Reverse a String iteratively and recursively

## WHITESPACE
* Strip whitespace from a string in-place
* Remove duplicate chars from a string ("AAA BBB" -> "A B")
	int RemoveDups(char* szStr)

* HARD: Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right

## DUPS
* Check if a String is composed of all unique characters
* How to find first non repeated character of a given String? (solution)
* How to count occurrence of a given character in a String? (solution)
* Find the first non-repeating character in a string:("ABCA" -> B )
	int FindFirstUnique(char* szStr)
- Remove Duplicates

## PATTERNS
* Write code to check a String is palindrome or not? (solution)
Palindrome are those String whose reverse is equal to original.This can be done by using either StringBuffer reverse() method or by technique demonstrated in the solution here.

* Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams
* Check if String is a palindrome
* Write a function to find out longest palindrome in a given string?
* Palindrome Substrings
* HARD: Find the shortest palindrome in a String


## CONVERSION
* Determine if a String is an int or a double


2) Write a method which will remove any given character from a String? (solution)
hint : you can remove a given character from String by converting it into character array and then using substring() method for removing them from output string.
