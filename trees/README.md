# TREES


Binary Trees
	* Implement the following functions for a binary tree:
	* 
		* Insert
		* PrintInOrder
		* PrintPreOrder
		* PrintPostOrder

	* Implement a non-recursive PrintInOrder

Trees

	* Implement a BST with insert and delete functions

	* Print a tree using BFS and DFS

	* Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST

	* Find the smallest element in a BST

	* Find the 2nd largest number in a BST

	* Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree

	* Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree

	* Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0

	* Print a tree by levels

	* Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree

	* Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.

	* HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.

	* HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings

Second Largest Item in BST »
Write a function to find the 2nd largest element in a binary search tree. Our first thought might be to do an in-order traversal of the BST, but this would take O(n)O(n)time and... keep reading »
