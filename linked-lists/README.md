# LINK LISTS




* Implement Insert and Delete for
** singly-linked linked list
** sorted linked list 
** circular linked list
int Delete(node** head, int deleteMe)
int Insert(node** head, int data)
* Split a linked list given a pivot value
	void Split(node* head, int pivot, node** lt, node** gt)
* Find if a linked list has a cycle in it. Now do it 	without marking nodes.
* Find the middle of a linked list. Now do it while only going through the list once. (same solution as finding cycles)

Linked Lists

* Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions)
* Find the Nth element in a linked list
* Remove the Nth element of a linked list
* Check if a linked list has cycles
* Given a circular linked list, find the node at the beginning of the loop. Example: A-->B-->C --> D-->E -->C, C is the node that begins the loop
* Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively
